  <p>more than two months ago i installed <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">poole</a> with the intent to document my coding progress on a simple <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> blog. i’d meant to use this first post to outline the steps i took to set it all up from the command line and describe whatever basic problem-solving had to take place along the way.</p>

<p>but i spent august into september traveling and september into october underwater at my very nontechnical day job, and now that i’m back at it, my recollection of any of this is vague at best. i’ll try to let this be a lesson to document as i work, and as i learn, and not to let these writeups linger.</p>

<p>there’s still more i want to do with this, and i’ll be experimenting with adapting the poole framework to my own taste. i found <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole">this post by joshua lande</a> with a few features i’d like to implement, like simple navigation and an archive showing past entries in list form. i’d also like the index page to show a preview of each post rather than the full text, and to show more than one post per page.</p>

<p>but before that i’ll try to write up and publish a couple of simple projects i’ve been working on, just to have something up here and start keeping a record. with any luck it’ll be less than two months until i do.</p>
